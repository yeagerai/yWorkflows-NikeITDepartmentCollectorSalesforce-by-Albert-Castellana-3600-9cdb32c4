# Component Name
NameEmailExtractor

# Description
The NameEmailExtractor component is a building block of a Yeager Workflow, designed to extract name and email information from a list of dictionaries containing the keys "name" and "email".

# Input and Output Models
The component uses input and output models for data validation and serialization. These models are defined by the following Pydantic classes:

- `NameEmailExtractorInputDict`: This model describes the input data and expects a `data` attribute, which is a list of dictionaries with string keys and values.
- `NameEmailExtractorOutputDict`: This model describes the output data and consists of an `extracted_data` attribute, which is a list of dictionaries containing the extracted name and email information.

# Parameters
- `args` (NameEmailExtractorInputDict): The input data in the form of a NameEmailExtractorInputDict instance, containing a list of dictionaries with keys "name" and "email".

# Transform Function
The transform() method processes the input data and returns the extracted name and email information as a NameEmailExtractorOutputDict object. It has the following steps:

1. Initialize an empty list called `results`.
2. Iterate through each item in the input data list.
3. Extract the name and email values from the current item, if available.
4. If both name and email values are present, create a new dictionary with keys "name" and "email" and their respective values.
5. Append the new dictionary to the `results` list.
6. Return the results as a NameEmailExtractorOutputDict object, containing the `extracted_data` attribute with the processed results.

# External Dependencies
- `typing`: This library is used to provide type hints in the form of `Any`, `Dict`, `List`, and `Union`.
- `pydantic`: This library is used to create the BaseModel classes for input and output data validation and serialization.
- `fastapi`: This library is used to create the FastAPI app for the REST API routes.

# API Calls
This component does not make any external API calls.

# Error Handling
The component relies on Pydantic BaseModel for validation of input and output data. If the input data does not conform to the expected schema, a validation error will be raised by Pydantic.

# Examples
To use the NameEmailExtractor component within a Yeager Workflow:

1. Initialize the component.
