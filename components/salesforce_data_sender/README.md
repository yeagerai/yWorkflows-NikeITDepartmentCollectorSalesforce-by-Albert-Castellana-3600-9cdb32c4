# Component Name

SalesforceDataSender

# Description

This component is responsible for sending data to Salesforce. The main functionality of `SalesforceDataSender` is to process input data and send it to a specified Salesforce object. It inherits from the `AbstractComponent` base class that defines common methods and properties required by Yeager components.

# Input and Output Models

## Input Model

**SalesforceDataSenderInputDict**:

- `name_and_email_list` (List[Dict[str, str]]): A list of dictionaries containing key-value pairs of names and emails.

## Output Model

**SalesforceDataSenderOutputDict**:

- `status_message` (str): A string message indicating the success or failure of sending data to Salesforce.

# Parameters

- `salesforce_credentials` (str): The path to the Salesforce credentials file containing the username, password, and security token. This is read from the component configuration and set as an environment variable.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method takes input data in the form of a `SalesforceDataSenderInputDict` and returns a `SalesforceDataSenderOutputDict` with a status message indicating the result of the operation. To accomplish this, the method does the following steps:

1. Read Salesforce credentials from the specified file and initializes a Salesforce instance using the `simple_salesforce` library.
2. Iterate over the input `name_and_email_list` and creates objects in Salesforce with the given data.
3. If there is any exception raised during the process, it sets the status message to indicate the failure along with a detailed message about the exception.
4. Returns the `SalesforceDataSenderOutputDict` containing the final status message.

# External Dependencies

- `os`: Used to access environment variables.
- `yaml`: Used to parse the component configuration and Salesforce credentials files.
- `fastapi`: Used to create a FastAPI instance for the component.
- `pydantic`: Used to define input and output data models with validation.
- `dotenv`: Used to load environment configurations from a `.env` file.
- `simple_salesforce`: Used to communicate with the Salesforce API.

# API Calls

The component uses the `simple_salesforce` library to make API calls to Salesforce. It creates objects in Salesforce with the input name and email data by calling the `sf.ObjectName.create()` method. The actual Salesforce object name needs to be replaced with "ObjectName" in the source code.

# Error Handling

The component uses a `try-except` block to handle errors during the data sending process. If any exception occurs, it sets the status message to indicate the failure and appends the exception's details to the message.

# Examples

To use the `SalesforceDataSender` component within a Yeager Workflow, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the required external dependencies are installed in your Python environment.
2. Set up the necessary environment variables (e.g., `SALESFORCE_CREDENTIALS`) and create a component configuration file with the appropriate parameters.
3. Use the component by calling the `transform()` method with a properly formatted `SalesforceDataSenderInputDict` object.
