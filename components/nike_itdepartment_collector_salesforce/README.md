# Component Name
NikeITDepartmentCollectorSalesforce

# Description
The NikeITDepartmentCollectorSalesforce component is a Yeager Workflow component designed to collect IT department data from the Nike system through an API and store it in a Salesforce system. The component inherits from the AbstractWorkflow base class and has a transform() method that processes input data and returns output data.

# Input and Output Models
## Input Model (`NikeITDepartmentCollectorSalesforceIn`)
- `SalesforceCredentials`: SalesforceCredentials (required)
  - `client_id`: str (required)
  - `client_secret`: str (required)
  - `username`: str (required)
  - `password`: str (required)
  - `security_token`: str (required)
- `API_URL`: str (required)

## Output Model (`NikeITDepartmentCollectorSalesforceOut`)
- `Status`: Status (required)
  - `success`: bool (required)
  - `message`: str (required)

# Parameters
- `args`: NikeITDepartmentCollectorSalesforceIn (required): The input data model for the component.
- `callbacks`: typing.Any (optional): A placeholder for any callbacks, but not used in this component.

# Transform Function
The `transform()` method of the NikeITDepartmentCollectorSalesforce component follows these steps:
1. Calls the `transform()` method of the super class (AbstractWorkflow) and passes `args` and `callbacks`.
2. Gets the IT department data from the Nike system and the Salesforce API status from the `results_dict`.
3. Creates a `Status` object with `success` and `message` from the Salesforce API status.
4. Returns a `NikeITDepartmentCollectorSalesforceOut` object containing the `Status` object.

# External Dependencies
- `typing`: Provides type hints for input, output, and variables.
- `dotenv`: Loads environment variables from a .env file.
- `fastapi`: Provides a web framework to expose the transform function via a REST endpoint.
- `pydantic`: Provides data validation and parsing for the input and output models.

# API Calls
The component relies on the AbstractWorkflow's `transform()` method to handle any external API calls required to interact with the Nike system and Salesforce API. The detailed usage and purpose of these API calls are abstracted away from this specific component.

# Error Handling
Error handling is delegated to the parent class (AbstractWorkflow) and the pydantic validation of input and output models. Any exceptions or validation errors will be raised and propagated by the parent class or the framework.

# Examples
